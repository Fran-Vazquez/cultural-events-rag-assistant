## ⚙️ How cultural-events-rag-assistant Works

The app collects public cultural event information from a service called OpenAgenda. It turns this data into a form that computers can easily search using a technique called embeddings. 

The app uses a tool called FAISS to find the best matches for your questions. It also uses a language model named Mistral to turn these matches into spoken answers that read naturally.

This whole system runs in a container using Docker, so all parts work together without you needing to install anything complicated.
